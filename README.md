# Phase 2 Motorsports

Phase 2 Motorsports is an eSports racing team, that i am a member of. 

The idea behind the project was to create a site where people who dont know what we do could better understand.

We also wanted a space where potential sponsors of the team could have an overview on what the team is about, meet the drivers
by including a profile page, and hosting contact page so they can get in touch with us.
 
The world of eSports is very foreingn to alot of people, so by creating a place where people could come and bulid an idea
of what it is, and what we do as a team was very important.

## UX
 
As a part of a good UX experience, i wanted users to be enguaged, and have a want to learn about what we are. 

My initial thought to achieve this goal was to not provide so much information that is was not worth their time.

lets be honest, not everyone likes to read pages of informaation, nor do the have the time to.

So keeping that in mind i wanted to provide as much information as i could without boring the user.


On the other hand, i wanted it to be pleasing to look at as well.

To achieve this, i wanted to keep the overall design and color scheeme the same across the entire site.

The pairing of the colorfull background, with the dark nav-bar and footer really makes it easy on the eyes to look at, and provides an eligant look as well.

Overall i am very happy with the UX, especialy given the fact that this was my first solo attempt at creating a site, and i will only continue to be better as i go on.


## Features

As mentioned before, eSports is a very foreingn thing to alot of people. 

So for the landing page i wanted to grab users attention stright away by providing the knowlage of who we are, and what we do.

As for any team weather it be racing or some type of buissness team, its important for users to know the people behind the operation, thats why i created a profile page with our drivers names, age, hometown, and profession.

Moving on to our partners page, i wanted to create a space to display the great companies who work with us to achieve our goals, and also a link to their respective websites.

Lastly for our contact page i wanted a simple page where anyone who wanted to get in touch with us could do so via our email, weather is be potential sponsors or curious users wanting to learn more about us.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users to visit our facebook page via a social link at the footer of the page.
- Feature 2 - allows users to visit a broadcasting page via the checkerd flag icon at the footer to watch recent streams of races we have competed in.
- Feature 3 - allows users to visit the iRacing profile pages of all of our drivers via an iRacing profile button, altho you will have to create an iRacing profile to view the profiles.
- Feature 4 - allows users to visit the websites of our partners to understand what they do as well.
- Feature 5 - social links are presented at the footer, however only the Facebook link is active, as we do not yet have an instagram or youtube, however we are working on getting them set up.

### Features Left to Implement
- I do have one feature i want provide in the future, and the would be to add a section where users can subscribe to a mailing list. However i do not have the skillset to provide this now, but it is someothing that will be added.

## Technologies Used

To create this site i used the following. HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, FONTAWESOME

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For testing my site and insuring that is provides a good UX i presented my project may different family members, and also some of my fellow teammates,
and asked for feedback.

I had many different people express different oppinions on the site, and carefully to their sugestions into consideration.

After having the feedback from different perspectives, i then implimited changes based off the feedback, and in result i believe it provided a stronger UX design.

In addition, i worked on making sure the site works well and looks good under different viewport sizes.

Im still not compleatly satisfied with look of things on smaller devices, as im not comfottable with media queires yet. 

However it is compleatly functional on all types of viewports, which is very important.

## Deployment

For deployment of my project i decided to use GitHub pages.

I have never dployed a project before, so it was the best soultion for me just because it gives well detailed steps on how it works and what to do.

have somewhere where fans/sponsors/felow competitors can get to know our drivers better, and also create a page where we can proudly display the great partners that support what we do.
